# Summarize AI Mobile

Mobile app for AI-powered document summarization. Summarize articles, PDFs, and research papers quickly and efficiently on the go.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Summarization:** Leverages advanced AI algorithms to generate concise and accurate summaries of various document types.
*   **Document Upload:** Allows users to upload documents directly from their mobile devices (e.g., PDFs, text files).
*   **URL Input:** Enables summarization of articles and web content by simply providing a URL.
*   **Multiple Document Types:** Supports summarizing articles, PDFs, research papers, and other text-based documents.
*   **Customizable Summary Length:** Provides options to adjust the length and level of detail in the generated summaries.
*   **Offline Access:** Allows users to access previously generated summaries even without an internet connection (depending on caching implementation).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a clean and intuitive mobile interface for a seamless user experience.
*   **History Tracking:** Keeps a record of previously summarized documents for easy access and review.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS) - Responsible for the mobile application's user interface and interactions.
*   **Backend:** Laravel (PHP) - Provides the API endpoints for document processing, summarization, and user authentication.
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (version 16 or higher) -  Required for running the React frontend.  Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm** or **yarn:** Package managers for JavaScript dependencies. npm is included with Node.js.
*   **PHP:** (version 8.0 or higher) - Required for running the Laravel backend.
*   **Composer:** PHP dependency manager.  Install from [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)
*   **MySQL or other compatible database:**  Used by the Laravel backend for data storage.
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **Emulator or physical mobile device:** For testing the React Native app

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd summarize-ai-mobile
```

**2. Backend Setup (Laravel):**

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your .env file with database credentials, app URL, and other necessary settings
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed  # Optional: Seed the database with initial data
php artisan serve
```

**3. Frontend Setup (React):**

```bash
cd ../frontend  # Go back to the project root and then into the frontend directory
npm install  # or yarn install
```

## Development Setup

**1. Backend Development:**

*   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
*   Use your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code, PHPStorm) to edit the Laravel code.
*   Start the Laravel development server: `php artisan serve`
*   Access the backend API endpoints at the address specified by `php artisan serve` (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

**2. Frontend Development:**

*   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
*   Use your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code) to edit the React Native code.
*   Start the React Native development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
*   Follow the instructions provided by the React Native CLI to run the app on an emulator or physical device.  This usually involves installing `expo-cli` globally and running `expo start`.

## Usage Examples

**1. Summarizing a Document via API:**

Send a POST request to the `/api/summarize` endpoint with the document text or URL in the request body.  Example (using `curl`):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/summarize \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "This is a long article that needs to be summarized.",
    "length": "short"  // Optional:  "short", "medium", "long"
  }'
```

The API will return a JSON response containing the summarized text.

**2. Using the Mobile App:**

*   Open the Summarize AI Mobile app on your device.
*   Select the desired input method: "Upload Document" or "Enter URL".
*   If uploading a document, choose the file from your device's storage.
*   If entering a URL, paste the URL of the article or web page.
*   Optionally, adjust the summary length setting.
*   Tap the "Summarize" button.
*   The app will display the generated summary.

## API Documentation Structure

The backend API follows a RESTful architecture. Key endpoints include:

*   **`POST /api/summarize`**:
    *   **Description:**  Summarizes the provided text or content from a URL.
    *   **Request Body:**
        *   `text` (string, optional): The text to summarize. Mutually exclusive with `url`.
        *   `url` (string, optional): The URL of the page to summarize. Mutually exclusive with `text`.
        *   `length` (string, optional): Desired summary length ("short", "medium", "long"). Defaults to "medium".
    *   **Response:**
        *   `summary` (string): The generated summary.

*   **`GET /api/history`**:
    *   **Description:** Retrieves the user's summary history. Requires authentication. (Authentication implementation details not included in this example, but would involve JWT or similar.)
    *   **Response:**
        *   `history` (array): An array of summary objects, each containing details like the original text/URL, summary, and timestamp.

*   **Authentication Endpoints (example):** (Implementation details not included, but this outlines potential endpoints)
    *   `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
    *   `POST /api/login`: Log in an existing user and obtain an authentication token.
    *   `POST /api/logout`: Log out the current user and invalidate the authentication token.

More detailed API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI) should be generated as the API evolves.
